# RAG-for-Answering-Questions-on-Research-Papers
I developed a RAG solution to answer questions about a repository of research papers. I parsed the paper PDF files, chunked and indexed the data, and then designed and executed an evaluation of the retriever results. RAG made the openai LLM, gpt-4o model, relatively successful at answering questions over a large number of research papers.
